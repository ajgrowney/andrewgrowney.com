# Personal Website
## Initial Goal
Built with React in a 6 hour challenge. Now maintained consistently as a personal portfolio and resume. Also potentially to be used for different types of future content.

## v2 Site Update (10/1/2021)
Migrated from a create-react-app project to GatsbyJs. This was an important goal in order to provide the performance and meta tags for blog posts.
